Good afternoon with all respect missus. With whom I have the pleasure of talking. My name is Gerar Quispe, I'm Peruvian.


yours as a company when called me to my cell phone number, the first time,
he did not tell me about the language options that I had, to communicate with the company.


I want to claim for a suscription doing in Jobs Across the
World company, it was made with my credit card, this payment was done without my
consent. The amount is $500 dollars for that I want my money back. The employee who assisted me and who made the transaction is called:
*Matthew Brown.*his e-mail:  Matthew.Brown@pro-immigration.email, 

I found out about this when a confirmation came to my email, with an
Order Date and Username that I never used.

Look, Miss, please I do not want to make any problem, I just want to get my money back.


(Que se presente, con quien estas hablando nombre completo y cargo) 


This could be interpreted as a fraud.
since someone called me to obtain my personal information and making a payment, and at the end they did not provide anything at all.

Gentlemen what annoy me is that he made payments without my consent with my card. that is a crime,  isn't it?
